Unfortunately, you ran into an unfortunate situation. Your vault, which holds on to most of your valuable possessions, was robbed. The robbers broke into the vault, stole or damaged most of your valuable possessions, and left. While a team is tracking them down, you realize you may be able to take things into your own hands. Since you are a lead developer on some very experimental technology, you have access to many restricted areas. Recently, your lab has been testing some temporary time travel, with the ability to create checkpoints in time that can be revisited. While the technology is still very new, you believe that this could be an alternate solution to your problem. If you can sneak into the bank before the robbers show up and grab some of the money, you would be able to survive while figuring out the rest of the issues. In order to do this, you have assembled a team of your most trusted colleagues. Your plan is to steal the time travel device, and use it to heist the bank of your items. Unfortunately, you have never used the device before. In order to make sure it functions, you need to run some preliminary tests. Luckily, you know of some secret facilities. You stock them with your own men, and get ready for your training. Before this, you make an attempt to get as much information as you can on the device you will be using.
